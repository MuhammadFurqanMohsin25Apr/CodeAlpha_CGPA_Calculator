In this task, I developed a basic banking system using C++. The system allows customers to manage multiple accounts, where they can deposit, withdraw, and transfer money. Each transaction is recorded, and you can view the transaction history along with the account balance. The program uses classes to represent the bank, customers, accounts, and transactions, showcasing how object-oriented programming can be applied to a real-world scenario.
