# CGPA Calculator in C++

## Description

This is a simple console-based application written in C++ that calculates the Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) based on the grades, course names, and credit hours provided by the user. The program also generates a summary table displaying the courses, grades, credit hours, and corresponding grade points.

## Features

- **User Input:** Allows users to input the number of courses, along with the course names, grades, and credit hours.
- **Grade Calculation:** Supports grade inputs ranging from A to F, each associated with its respective grade point.
- **CGPA Calculation:** Computes the overall CGPA by taking into account the grades and credit hours for each course.
